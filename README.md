<br>
<br>
Welcome to the **Simple Calculator**! This is a basic calculator program built with Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
<br>
This project was built to `practice` working with:
<br>
Python's basic input/output functions.
<br>
Conditional statements and control flow.
<br>
Basic arithmetic operations.
<br>
##Features<br>
Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
<br>
Handle division by zero errors gracefully.
<br>
Supports both integer and decimal inputs.
<br>
##How it works:
<p align="center"> Enter the operator (+, -, *, /, ^) and two numbers: <br/> <img src="https://github.com/Coy0000/calculator/blob/main/Capture1.PNG" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Input"/> <br /> <br /> Example calculation for addition: <br/> <img src="https://github.com/Coy0000/calculator/blob/main/Capture2.PNG" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Addition"/> <br /> <br /> Example calculation for division: <br/> <img src="https://github.com/Coy0000/calculator/blob/main/Capture3.PNG" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Division"/> <br /> <br /> Example of invalid operator input: <br/> <img src="https://github.com/Coy0000/calculator/blob/main/Capture4.PNG" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Invalid Operator"/> <br /> <br /> </p>
<br>
<h3><b>Future Improvements<b><h3>
Add more advanced mathematical operations (e.g., square roots, trigonometric functions).
<br>
Support for multiple calculations in one session (e.g., chain operations).
<br>
Implement error handling for non-numeric inputs or invalid operations.
