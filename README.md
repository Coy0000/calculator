# Simple Calculator

Welcome to the **Simple Calculator**! This is a basic calculator program built with Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

This project was built to practice working with:
- Python's basic input/output functions.
- Conditional statements and control flow.
- Basic arithmetic operations.

## Features
- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
- Handle division by zero errors gracefully.
- Supports both integer and decimal inputs.

## How it works:
<p align="center"> 
Enter the operator (+, -, *, /, ^) and two numbers: <br/>

<br /> 
<br /> 
Example calculation for addition: <br/>

### Future Improvements
- Add more advanced mathematical operations (e.g., square roots, trigonometric functions).
- Support for multiple calculations in one session (e.g., chain operations).
- Implement error handling for non-numeric inputs or invalid operations.
